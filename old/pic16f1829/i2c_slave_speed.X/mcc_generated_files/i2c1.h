  I2C Slave Driver Status

  @Summary
    Defines the different status that the slave driver has
    detected over the i2c bus.

  @Description
    This defines the different status that the slave driver has
    detected over the i2c bus. The status is passed to the
    I2C1_StatusCallback() callback function that is implemented by
    the user of the slave driver as a parameter to inform the user
    that there was a change in the status of the driver due to
    transactions on the i2c bus. User of the slave driver can use these
    to manage the read or write buffers.
